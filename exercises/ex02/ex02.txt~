Theory
Atomic operation: an operation which cannot be split up, and has to be completed as a whole. 
Semaphore: a counter which keeps track of a resource. If a program wants to access the resource, it can issue a WAIT, decrementing the semaphore. If the value of the semaphore is 0 or lower, the program has to wait. When the counter reaches 1 or higher, the program gets to run. When the program is done using the resource, it issues a SIGNAL, incrementing the semaphore.
Mutex: like a binary semaphore, except it has a sense of ownership. Only the process which locked the mutex can unlock it.
Critical section: a part of a programs code
